## 👋 Hi, I'm Paras!

I'm a passionate Python developer with a focus on **web scraping** and **FastAPI development**. I love building efficient and scalable solutions for extracting data from the web and designing APIs that streamline data access.

## 🕸️ Web Scraping Expertise
With experience in libraries like **BeautifulSoup**, **Scrapy**, and **Selenium**, I am adept at scraping data from static and dynamic websites. I handle tasks such as:
- Pagination and handling complex site structures.
- Managing authentication and handling session-based scraping.
- Extracting structured data efficiently and accurately.

## ⚙️ FastAPI Development
As an experienced **FastAPI** developer, I build high-performance RESTful APIs, focusing on:
- Creating well-documented API endpoints with automatic documentation generation.
- Leveraging asynchronous programming to improve API responsiveness.
- Ensuring scalability and rapid deployment of backend services.

## 🐍 Python Mastery
I have a strong command of the Python programming language and its vast ecosystem, including libraries like:
- **Requests** for making HTTP requests.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis.
- Writing clean, maintainable, and optimized code for various applications.

## 🚀 Problem Solving
I enjoy tackling complex challenges using Python, finding creative solutions to optimize performance and automate workflows. My problem-solving skills include:
- Troubleshooting issues and identifying bottlenecks in code.
- Algorithmic problem solving to ensure robustness and efficiency.

## 📈 Continuous Learning
I'm always keen to stay updated with the latest trends in web scraping, API design, and Python development. Continuous learning is my priority as I strive to sharpen my skills and take on new challenges.
